I am a Research Assistant Professor at the [Department of Journalism](http://www.jour.hkbu.edu.hk/faculty-member/dr-xinzhi-zhang/) of [Hong Kong Baptist University](http://www.hkbu.edu.hk). My research areas include comparative political communication, digital media and social change, new media and public health, and the sociology of news in the digital age.

As a social scientist (with quantitative methods) by training, I am now fully devoted into the research and teaching on computational social science and digital humanities. I use several data analytics toolkits and programming languages such as [R](http://www.r-project.org), [Python](https://www.python.org), web-based data visualization (HTML, CSS, Javascript), and [Gephi](https://gephi.org). I have published 16 peer-reviewed research articles, all since 2014, on top-tier SSCI journals such as *Computers in Human Behavior*, *Health Communication*, *Digital Journalism*, *International Political Science Review*, *International Journal of Communication*, *Telecommunications Policy*, *International Communication Gazette*, and *Policy & Internet*.

I am the Director of [Data and Media Communication Concentration](http://bu-dmc.hkbu.edu.hk), an interdisciplinary concentration jointly offered by the Department of Computer Science and the Department of Journalism. I am also the founding Director of Master of Science in AI and Digital Media, offered by the School of Communication and supported by the Department of Computer Science, which is the first postgraduate programme of its kind in Hong Kong.

I have taught several interdisciplinary courses on digital media, multimedia storytelling, and the application of data science in media communication, such as *Multimedia Communication*, *Communication Theory*, *Issues and Cases in Mass Communication*, *Languages, Cultures, and Communication*, *Social Media Data Acquisition and Processing with Python* ([Course Repo](https://github.com/xzzhang2/201819A_cityu_com5507)), and workshops on Python programming ([Workshop Repo](https://github.com/xzzhang2/201811_budmc_Invitation2Py)) and data-driven journalism. I supervise undergraduate final year projects (honours projects) and postgraduate research projects.

Before joining the Baptist U in 2016, I was a Lecturer and the Co-Convener of the Academic Discipline of Humanities at the [School of Professional Education and Executive Development at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.speed-polyu.edu.hk) (2014-16). I obtained Ph.D. in Media and Communication (2013) and M.A. *with Distinction* in Communication and New Media (2009) from the [Department of Media and Communication](http://www6.cityu.edu.hk/com/) at [City University of Hong Kong](www.cityu.edu.hk). I obtained B.A. in Broadcasting Journalism (Internet Communication Stream) (2008) at Guangzhou University. I am from Shenzhen, China.

Besides scholarly activities, I am a keen lover of classic music, films, and stage drama. I play piano and jazz drum.
