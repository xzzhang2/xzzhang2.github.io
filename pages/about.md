My name is Xinzhi Zhang. Currently I am a Research Assistant Professor at the [Department of Journalism](http://www.jour.hkbu.edu.hk/eng/people/dr-xinzhi-zhang/) of [Hong Kong Baptist University](http://www.hkbu.edu.hk).  

My research areas include comparative political communication, new media and social change, social movements, data-driven journalism, and emerging media and the sociology of news. As a social scientist by taining, I am also expending the research repertoire to computational social science and digital humanities, with data analytics toolkits including [R](http://www.r-project.org), [Python](https://www.python.org), web-based data visualization (HTML, CSS, Javascript), and [Gephi](https://gephi.org). I have published several articles on *CHB*, *IPSR*, *IJoC*, *DJ*, and others.  

I obtained both Ph.D. in Media and Communication (2013) and M.A. with Distinction in Communication and New Media (2009) from the [Department of Media and Communication](http://www6.cityu.edu.hk/com/) at [City University of Hong Kong](www.cityu.edu.hk). I obtained B.A. in Broadcasting Journalism (Internet Communication Stream) (2008) at Guangzhou University. I am from Shenzhen, China. 

Currently I am the Associate Programme Director of the Interdisciplinary Concentration on [Data and Media Communication](http://bu-dmc.hkbu.edu.hk). Before joining the Baptist U in 2016, I was a Lecturer and the Co-Convener of the Academic Discipline of Humanities at the [School of Professional Education and Executive Development at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.speed-polyu.edu.hk) (2014-16).

Besides scholarly activities, I am a keen lover of music, films, and stage drama. I play piano and jazz drum.
