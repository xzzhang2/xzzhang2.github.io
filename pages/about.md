My name is Xinzhi Zhang. Currently I am a Research Assistant Professor at the [Department of Journalism](http://www.jour.hkbu.edu.hk/eng/people/dr-xinzhi-zhang/) of [Hong Kong Baptist University](http://www.hkbu.edu.hk).  

My research areas include comparative political communication, new media and social change, social movements, data-driven journalism, and emerging media and the sociology of news. As a social scientist by taining, I am also expending the research repertoire to computational social science and digital humanities, as a coder with [R](http://www.r-project.org), Python, Javascript, D3, and Gephi. 

I obtained both Ph.D. in Media and Communication (2013) and M.A. with Distinction in Communication and New Media (2009) from the [Department of Media and Communication](http://www6.cityu.edu.hk/com/) at [City University of Hong Kong](www.cityu.edu.hk). I obtained B.A. in Broadcasting Journalism (Internet Communicatino Stream) (2008) at Guangzhou University. I am from Shenzhen, China.
