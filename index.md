Welcome! I am Xinzhi Zhang, Associate Professor and Director of Research in the [Department of Media and Communication](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/com/Profile.aspx?u=xzzhang2) at the [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/) (CityUHK). 

My research focuses on digital journalism, political communication, technology and global governance, and computational social science. I study how AI and media innovation—such as Generative AI and digital platforms—are reshaping news production, public engagement, and policymaking. My research centers on how human-AI collaboration can enhance creativity and productivity while safeguarding information integrity. I also address the ethical and policy challenges of AI-driven human communication, advancing responsible innovation and promoting an informed, equitable society. My research profile is on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=iOFeIDIAAAAJ). 

I have authored over 50 peer-reviewed articles in top-tier journals such as *Human Communication Research*, *Journal of Communication*, *Digital Journalism*, *Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly*, *Information Communication & Society*, *Social Media + Society*, and *International Journal of Press/Politics*, earning top paper awards from the International Communication Association (**ICA**) and the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication (**AEJMC**). [Here are my publications.](https://xzzhang2.github.io/pages/pubs.html)

My work has been funded by the Hong Kong Research Grants Council (**RGC**), a prestigious internationally competitive funding scheme, and the Public Policy Research Funding Scheme (**PPR**) by the Hong Kong SAR Government. [Here are my funded research projects.](https://xzzhang2.github.io/pages/projects.html)

Before joining CityUHK in 2024, I was an Associate Professor in the Department of Journalism and the Department of Interactive Media in the School of Communication at the [Hong Kong Baptist University](https://www.hkbu.edu.hk/) and the founding Programme Director (2019 - 23) of [Master of Science in AI and Digital Media](https://ar.hkbu.edu.hk/tpg-admissions/programmes/master-of-science-msc-in-ai-and-digital-media-approved-programme-under-ugc-s-targeted-tpg-programmes-fellowships-scheme), a pioneering postgraduate program of its kind in the Asia-Pacific region.  

Currently, I serve on the editorial boards of four top journals in media and communication, including [*Human Communication Research*](https://academic.oup.com/hcr), [*Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly*](https://journals.sagepub.com/home/jmq), [*Digital Journalism*](https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/rdij20/current), and [*Chinese Journal of Communication*](https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/rcjc20/current).  

I also actively contribute as a columnist to leading media outlets, including *Radio Television Hong Kong* (RTHK), *Hong Kong Economic Journal*, and *FTChinese* (the Chinese edition of the *Financial Times*).

I obtained Ph.D. in Media and Communication (2013) and an M.A. *with Distinction* in Communication and New Media (2009) from the [Department of Media and Communication](http://www6.cityu.edu.hk/com/) at [City University of Hong Kong](www.cityu.edu.hk). I was a Visiting Scholar at the Department of Communication at [University of California, Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/) in 2022.
