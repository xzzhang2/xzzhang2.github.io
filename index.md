Welcome. I am Xinzhi Zhang, currently an Assistant Professor at the [Department of Interactive Media](https://scholars.hkbu.edu.hk/en/persons/xinzhi-zhang-11) in the School of Communication at [Hong Kong Baptist University](http://www.hkbu.edu.hk).   

My research interests include political communication, digital journalism, digital public health campaigns, and computational social science. My research is motivated by two lines of inquiry: (1) how people receive, process, and engage with information on politics and health on digital media and (2) how communication technologies are changing how news is produced and delivered to audiences. I am devoting myself to the computational communication research, using digital data and computational methods for theory-driven research. My research profiles are on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=iOFeIDIAAAAJ&hl=en), [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Xinzhi_Zhang3), and [Scopus](https://scholars.hkbu.edu.hk/en/persons/xinzhi-zhang-11). 

I have published numerous articles in top-tier journals such as *Computers in Human Behavior*, *Social Media + Society*, *Journalism*, *Social Science Computer Review*, *Health Communication*, *Digital Journalism*, and *International Journal of Communication*. [[Here is my publication list](https://xzzhang2.github.io/pages/pubs.html)]

I was awarded two research grants from the General Research Fund (**GRF**) by the University Grants Committee (**UGC**), the Hong Kong SAR, a prestigious internationally competitive funding scheme. I have completed a research project funded by the former Public Policy Research Funding Scheme (**PPR**) from the Policy Innovation and Co-ordination Office (**PICO**) of the Hong Kong SAR Government (2021). [[Here is the list of my funded research projects](https://xzzhang2.github.io/pages/projects.html)] 

I am the founding Programme Director of [Master of Science (MSc) in AI and Digital Media](https://gs.hkbu.edu.hk/programmes/master-of-science-msc-in-ai-and-digital-media) (2019 - Present), a pioneering interdisciplinary postgraduate programme of its kind in Hong Kong. The Programme is selected to be funded by the [Targeted Taught Postgraduate Programmes Fellowships Scheme](https://www.ugc.edu.hk/eng/ugc/activity/targeted_postgraduate_scheme.html) by the University Grants Committee (**UGC**), the Hong Kong SAR. I was also one of the founding members—and later the Programme Director—of [Data and Media Communication Concentration](http://bu-dmc.hkbu.edu.hk) (2017 - 19), the first undergraduate concentration in Hong Kong on data-driven news reporting and storytelling. 

I am the recipient of **HKBU's Performance Award as Young Researcher** in 2021. I am also the recipient of **HKBU's Performance Award in Teaching** in 2022. 

I am the Editorial Board Member of [*Digital Journalism*](https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/rdij20/current), an international leading journal in digital journalism studies. 

I obtained Ph.D. in Media and Communication (2013) and an M.A. *with Distinction* in Communication and New Media (2009) from the [Department of Media and Communication](http://www6.cityu.edu.hk/com/) at [City University of Hong Kong](www.cityu.edu.hk).
