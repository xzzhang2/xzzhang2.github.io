Welcome. I am Xinzhi Zhang, currently an Assistant Professor at the [Department of Journalism](http://www.jour.hkbu.edu.hk/faculty-member/dr-xinzhi-zhang/) of [Hong Kong Baptist University](http://www.hkbu.edu.hk), and in University's [Augmented Creativity Lab](https://interdisciplinary-research.hkbu.edu.hk/cluster-and-lab/lab/augmented-creativity), one of the six interdisciplinary research laboratories of the Hong Kong Baptist University. 

As a social scientist by training, I am devoted to the interdisciplinary research on computational communication research, digital journalism, political communication and culture, media and public health, and human-machine collaborative creativity. My research profiles include [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=iOFeIDIAAAAJ&hl=en), [Publons](https://publons.com/researcher/1613458/xinzhi-zhang), and [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Xinzhi_Zhang3).

I have published numerous peer-reviewed articles on top-tier communication journals such as *Computers in Human Behavior*, *Social Science Computer Review*, *Health Communication*, *Digital Journalism*, *Telematics and Informatics*, and *International Journal of Communication*. [[Here is my full publication list](http://drxinzhizhang.com/pages/pubs.html)]

I was awarded two research grants by the General Research Fund (**GRF**) by the University Grants Committee (**UGC**), the Hong Kong SAR, an internationally competitive research funding scheme. I have also secured a grant from the Public Policy Research Funding Scheme (**PPR**) from the Policy Innovation and Co-ordination Office (**PICO**) of the Hong Kong Government. [[Here is the list of my research projects](http://drxinzhizhang.com/pages/projects.html)] 

I am the founding Programme Director of [Master of Science in AI and Digital Media](http://comd.hkbu.edu.hk/masters/en/aidm) (2018 - Present), a pioneering interdisciplinary postgraduate programme of its kind in Hong Kong. The Programme is selected to be funded by the [Targeted Taught Postgraduate Programmes Fellowships Scheme](https://www.ugc.edu.hk/eng/ugc/activity/targeted_postgraduate_scheme.html) by the University Grants Committee (**UGC**), the Hong Kong SAR. I was also one of the founding members—and later the Programme Director—of [Data and Media Communication Concentration](http://bu-dmc.hkbu.edu.hk) (2017 - 19), which is the first undergraduate concentration in Hong Kong on data-driven investigative reporting and storytelling. 

I obtained Ph.D. in Media and Communication (2013) and M.A. *with Distinction* in Communication and New Media (2009) from the [Department of Media and Communication](http://www6.cityu.edu.hk/com/) at [City University of Hong Kong](www.cityu.edu.hk).
