Welcome! I am Xinzhi Zhang. This is my personal webpage.

I am a Research Assistant Professor at the [Department of Journalism](http://www.jour.hkbu.edu.hk/faculty-member/dr-xinzhi-zhang/) of [Hong Kong Baptist University](http://www.hkbu.edu.hk).

I obtained both Ph.D. in Media and Communication (2013) and M.A. *with Distinction* in Communication and New Media (2009) from the [Department of Media and Communication](http://www6.cityu.edu.hk/com/) at [City University of Hong Kong](www.cityu.edu.hk).

As a social scientist by training, I am now devoted to the research and teaching on computational social science and digital humanities. My major research streams are:

  1. comparative political communication—media and social change, political engagement, expression and resistance—from a cross-polity and cross-disciplinary perspective;
  2. the sociology of journalism in the digital age, with computational methods (social network analysis, text mining, and machine learning);
  3. health communication, focusing on how cultural and political factors, and medium and message features affect the effectiveness of health promotional messages in a multimedia communication environment, and
  4. digital popular culture, particularly the reflection of gender and power in entertainment programmes.

I have published 17 peer-reviewed research articles, all since 2013, on top-tier journals such as *Computers in Human Behavior*, *Health Communication*, *Digital Journalism*, *International Political Science Review*, *International Journal of Communication*, *Telecommunications Policy*, *Policy & Internet*, among others.

I teach interdisciplinary courses on digital media, multimedia storytelling, and the application of data science in media communication, such as *AI for Digital Media*, *Multimedia Communication*, and *Social Media Data Acquisition and Processing with Python.* I have organized several workshops and seminars on Python programming, data visualization, and data journalism production.

I am the founding Director of [Master of Science in AI and Digital Media](http://comd.hkbu.edu.hk/masters/en/aidm), offered by the School of Communication and supported by the Department of Computer Science, which is the first postgraduate programme of its kind in Hong Kong. I have also served as one of the founding members—and later the Director—of [Data and Media Communication Concentration](http://bu-dmc.hkbu.edu.hk)(2017 - 19), which is an interdisciplinary undergraduate concentration on computational journalism and data-driven storytelling, jointly offered by the Department of Computer Science and the Department of Journalism.

Before joining the Baptist U in 2016, I was a Lecturer and the Co-Convener of the Academic Discipline of Humanities at the [School of Professional Education and Executive Development at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.speed-polyu.edu.hk) (2014-16).
