Welcome! I am Xinzhi Zhang. This is my personal website.

I am a Research Assistant Professor at the [Department of Journalism](http://www.jour.hkbu.edu.hk/faculty-member/dr-xinzhi-zhang/) of [Hong Kong Baptist University](http://www.hkbu.edu.hk). My research areas include comparative political communication, new media and social change, new media and public health, and digital journalism. As a social scientist by training, I am expending the research repertoire to computational social science and digital humanities. I have published 17 peer-reviewed academic research articles (14 SCI/SSCI journals), all since 2012, on journals such as *Computers in Human Behavior*, *Digital Journalism*, *International Political Science Review*, *International Journal of Communication*, *Telecommunications Policy*, *International Communication Gazette*, and *Policy & Internet*.

Currently I serve as the Programme Director of [Data and Media Communication Concentration](http://bu-dmc.hkbu.edu.hk), an interdisciplinary concentration jointly offered by the Department of Computer Science and the Department of Journalism. I have taught several interdisciplinary courses on digital media, multimedia storytelling, and the application of data science in media communication, such as *Multimedia Communication*, *Communication Theory*, *Issues and Cases in Mass Communication*, *Languages, Cultures, and Communication*, *Social Media Data Acquisition and Processing with Python* ([Course Repo](https://github.com/xzzhang2/201819A_cityu_com5507)), and workshops on Python programming ([Workshop Repo](https://github.com/xzzhang2/201811_budmc_Invitation2Py)) and data-driven journalism. I supervise undergraduate final year projects (honours projects) and postgraduate research projects.

Before joining the Baptist U in 2016, I was a Lecturer and the Co-Convener of the Academic Discipline of Humanities at the [School of Professional Education and Executive Development at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.speed-polyu.edu.hk) (2014-16). I obtained Ph.D. in Media and Communication (2013) and M.A. *with Distinction* in Communication and New Media (2009) from the [Department of Media and Communication](http://www6.cityu.edu.hk/com/) at [City University of Hong Kong](www.cityu.edu.hk).

Besides scholarly activities, I am a keen lover of classic music, films, and stage drama. I play piano and jazz drum.
