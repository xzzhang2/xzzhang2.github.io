Welcome. I am Xinzhi Zhang, currently an Assistant Professor at the [Department of Journalism](http://www.jour.hkbu.edu.hk/faculty-member/dr-xinzhi-zhang/) of [Hong Kong Baptist University](http://www.hkbu.edu.hk).  

My research spans political communication and digital culture, health communication, and computational digital storytelling; and is motivated by two lines of inquiry: (1) how people receive, process, and engage with information on politics and health on digital media and (2) how emerging technologies—especially platforms and algorithms—are changing how media contents are produced and distributed to audiences. I am devoting myself to computational communication research, using online digital footprint data and computational methods (network analysis, text mining, and machine learning) for communication theory-driven research. My research profiles are on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=iOFeIDIAAAAJ&hl=en), [Publons](https://publons.com/researcher/1613458/xinzhi-zhang), [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Xinzhi_Zhang3), and [Scopus](https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&authorId=55330999000&origin=inward). 

I have published numerous articles in top-tier journals such as *Journalism*, *Computers in Human Behavior*, *Social Science Computer Review*, *Health Communication*, *Digital Journalism*, *Journalism Practice*, and *International Journal of Communication*. [[Here is my publication list](http://drxinzhizhang.com/pages/pubs.html)]

I was awarded two research grants from the General Research Fund (**GRF**) by the University Grants Committee (**UGC**), the Hong Kong SAR, a prestigious internationally competitive funding scheme (2019 and 2020, respectively). As the solo PI, I have won a research grant from the Public Policy Research Funding Scheme (**PPR**) from the Policy Innovation and Co-ordination Office (**PICO**) of the Hong Kong Government (2021). [[Here is the list of my funded research projects](http://drxinzhizhang.com/pages/projects.html)] 

I am the founding Programme Director of [Master of Science in AI and Digital Media](http://comd.hkbu.edu.hk/masters/en/aidm) (2018 - Present), a pioneering interdisciplinary postgraduate programme of its kind in Hong Kong. The Programme is selected to be funded by the [Targeted Taught Postgraduate Programmes Fellowships Scheme](https://www.ugc.edu.hk/eng/ugc/activity/targeted_postgraduate_scheme.html) by the University Grants Committee (**UGC**), the Hong Kong SAR. I was also one of the founding members—and later the Programme Director—of [Data and Media Communication Concentration](http://bu-dmc.hkbu.edu.hk) (2017 - 19), the first undergraduate concentration in Hong Kong on data-driven news reporting and storytelling. I am the recipient of **HKBU's Performance Award as Young Researcher** in 2019. 

I obtained Ph.D. in Media and Communication (2013) and an M.A. *with Distinction* in Communication and New Media (2009) from the [Department of Media and Communication](http://www6.cityu.edu.hk/com/) at [City University of Hong Kong](www.cityu.edu.hk).
