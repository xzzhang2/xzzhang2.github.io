Welcome. I am Xinzhi Zhang. I am currently an Assistant Professor at the [Department of Journalism](http://www.jour.hkbu.edu.hk/faculty-member/dr-xinzhi-zhang/) of [Hong Kong Baptist University](http://www.hkbu.edu.hk), and attached to the [University Research Cluster on Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence](http://hkbu.ai).

As a social scientist by training, I am devoted to the interdisciplinary research on computational communication studies, digital politics, and digital humanities. My major research foci include (1) comparative political communication; (2) the sociology of digital journalism; (3) media and public health; and (4) digital popular culture. My research profile can be found on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=iOFeIDIAAAAJ&hl=en), [Publons](https://publons.com/researcher/1613458/xinzhi-zhang), and [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Xinzhi_Zhang3).

I have published **20** peer-reviewed research articles on top-tier journals such as *Computers in Human Behavior*, *Health Communication*, *Digital Journalism*, *International Political Science Review*, *International Journal of Communication*, among others. [[Here is my publication list](http://drxinzhizhang.com/pages/pubs.html)]

My research project has been funded by the General Research Fund (**GRF**) by the University Grants Committee (UGC), the Hong Kong SAR, an internationally competitive funding scheme. I also completed two projects supported by the Faculty Research Grant in Hong Kong Baptist University. [[Here is the list of my research projects](http://drxinzhizhang.com/pages/projects.html)]

I have been appointed as the founding Programme Director of [Master of Science in AI and Digital Media](http://comd.hkbu.edu.hk/masters/en/aidm) (2019 - Present), which is the first postgraduate programme of its kind in Hong Kong. I was one of the founding members—and later being appointed as the Programme Director—of [Data and Media Communication Concentration](http://bu-dmc.hkbu.edu.hk) (2017 - 19), an interdisciplinary undergraduate concentration on data-driven storytelling and computational journalism.

I obtained Ph.D. in Media and Communication (2013) and M.A. *with Distinction* in Communication and New Media (2009) from the [Department of Media and Communication](http://www6.cityu.edu.hk/com/) at [City University of Hong Kong](www.cityu.edu.hk).
