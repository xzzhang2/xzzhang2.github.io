Welcome! I am Xinzhi Zhang. This is my profile page.

My research areas include comparative political communication, new media and social change, social movements, data-driven journalism, new media and public health, and emerging information and communication technologies and the sociology of news. As a social scientist by training, I am expending the research repertoire to computational social science and digital humanities, with a focus on the approaches of text mining, social network analysis, and interactive data visualization. I have published 17 peer-reviewed academic research articles (14 SCI/SSCI journals), all since 2012, including *Computers in Human Behavior*, *Digital Journalism*, *International Political Science Review*, *International Journal of Communication*, *Telecommunications Policy*, *International Communication Gazette*, and *Policy & Internet*.

I have taught several interdisciplinary courses on digital media, storytelling, and the application of big data in media communication, such as *Multimedia Communication* (broadcasting media), *Films and Storytelling* (scripts and narrative), *Languages, Cultures, and Communication* (texts and discourse), and *Social Media Data Acquisition and Processing with Python* ([Course Repo](https://github.com/xzzhang2/201819A_cityu_com5507)), and Python Workshop ([Workshop Repo](https://github.com/xzzhang2/201811_budmc_Invitation2Py)). I also supervise final year projects (capstone/honours projects) at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels.

Currently I am a Research Assistant Professor at the [Department of Journalism](http://www.jour.hkbu.edu.hk/faculty-member/dr-xinzhi-zhang/) of [Hong Kong Baptist University](http://www.hkbu.edu.hk). It is my honor to serve as the Programme Director of the interdisciplinary concentration of [Data and Media Communication](http://bu-dmc.hkbu.edu.hk). Before joining the Baptist U in 2016, I was a Lecturer and the Co-Convener of the Academic Discipline of Humanities at the [School of Professional Education and Executive Development at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.speed-polyu.edu.hk) (2014-16). I obtained both Ph.D. in Media and Communication (2013) and M.A. *with Distinction* in Communication and New Media (2009) from the [Department of Media and Communication](http://www6.cityu.edu.hk/com/) at [City University of Hong Kong](www.cityu.edu.hk).

Besides scholarly activities, I am a keen lover of classic music, films, and stage drama. I play piano and jazz drum.
