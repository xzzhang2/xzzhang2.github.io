Welcome! This is Xinzhi Zhang.

I am a Research Assistant Professor at the [Department of Journalism](http://www.jour.hkbu.edu.hk/faculty-member/dr-xinzhi-zhang/) of [Hong Kong Baptist University](http://www.hkbu.edu.hk).

I obtained both Ph.D. in Media and Communication (2013) and M.A. *with Distinction* in Communication and New Media (2009) from the [Department of Media and Communication](http://www6.cityu.edu.hk/com/) at [City University of Hong Kong](www.cityu.edu.hk).

As a social scientist by training, I am now fully devoted into the research and teaching on computational social science and digital humanities. My four research niches are:
    1. comparative political communication, media and social change;
    2. the representation of pubic knowledge on social media, with big data analytics and digital traces;
    3. the sociology of news in the digital age, the production and effects of multimedia- multiplatform digital journalism, and
    4. digital humanities and popular culture.

I have published 16 peer-reviewed research articles, all since 2014, on top-tier SSCI journals such as *Computers in Human Behavior*, *Health Communication*, *Digital Journalism*, *International Political Science Review*, *International Journal of Communication*, *Telecommunications Policy*, and *Policy & Internet*.

I have taught several interdisciplinary courses on digital media, multimedia storytelling, and the application of data science in media communication, such as *AI for Digital Media*, *Multimedia Communication*, *Languages, Cultures, and Communications*, and *Social Media Data Acquisition and Processing with Python.* I have organized several workshops and seminars on Python programming, data visualization, and data journalism production.

Currently I am the (founding) Director of Master of Science in AI and Digital Media, offered by the School of Communication and supported by the Department of Computer Science, which is the first postgraduate programme of its kind in Hong Kong. I have also served as one of the founding members as well as later the Director of [Data and Media Communication Concentration](http://bu-dmc.hkbu.edu.hk), an interdisciplinary concentration jointly offered by the Department of Computer Science and the Department of Journalism from 2017 - 2019.

Before joining the Baptist U in 2016, I was a Lecturer and the Co-Convener of the Academic Discipline of Humanities at the [School of Professional Education and Executive Development at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.speed-polyu.edu.hk) (2014-16).

I am a keen lover of classic music, films, and stage drama. I play piano and jazz drum.
