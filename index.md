Welcome. I am Xinzhi Zhang, currently an Assistant Professor at the [Department of Journalism](http://www.jour.hkbu.edu.hk/faculty-member/dr-xinzhi-zhang/) of [Hong Kong Baptist University](http://www.hkbu.edu.hk), and in the [University Research Cluster on Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence](http://hkbu.ai). 

As a social scientist by training, I am devoted to the interdisciplinary research on computational communication research, digital politics and journalism, and digital humanities. My major research foci include (1) comparative political communication, digital politics, and digital culture; (2) the sociology of computational journalism; and (3) digital media and public health. My research profiles can be found on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=iOFeIDIAAAAJ&hl=en), [Publons](https://publons.com/researcher/1613458/xinzhi-zhang), and [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Xinzhi_Zhang3).

I have published **23** peer-reviewed articles on top-tier journals such as *Computers in Human Behavior*, *Social Science Computer Review*, *Health Communication*, *Digital Journalism*, *International Political Science Review*, *International Journal of Communication*, among others. [[Here is my full publication list](http://drxinzhizhang.com/pages/pubs.html)]

I was awarded two research grants by the General Research Fund (**GRF**) by the University Grants Committee (**UGC**), the Hong Kong SAR, an internationally competitive funding scheme. I have also completed three research projects supported by Hong Kong Baptist University. [[Here is the list of my research projects](http://drxinzhizhang.com/pages/projects.html)]

I have been appointed as the founding Programme Director of [Master of Science in AI and Digital Media](http://comd.hkbu.edu.hk/masters/en/aidm) (2019 - Present), which is the first postgraduate programme of its kind in Hong Kong. I was one of the founding members—and later being appointed as the Programme Director—of [Data and Media Communication Concentration](http://bu-dmc.hkbu.edu.hk) (2017 - 19), a pioneering interdisciplinary undergraduate concentration on data-driven storytelling and computational journalism. 

I obtained Ph.D. in Media and Communication (2013) and M.A. *with Distinction* in Communication and New Media (2009) from the [Department of Media and Communication](http://www6.cityu.edu.hk/com/) at [City University of Hong Kong](www.cityu.edu.hk).
