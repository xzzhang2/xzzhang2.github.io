Welcome! I am Xinzhi Zhang. This is my profile page.

My research areas include comparative political communication, new media and social change, social movements, data-driven journalism, and emerging information and communication technologies and the sociology of news. As a social scientist by taining, I am also expending the research repertoire to computational social science and digital humanities. I have published 16 peer-reviewed academic research articles (12 SCI/SSCI journals), all since 2013, including *Computers in Human Behavior*, *International Political Science Review*, *International Journal of Communication*, *Digital Journalism*, *Telecommunications Policy*, *International Communication Gazette*, and *Policy & Internet*. 

Currently I am a Research Assistant Professor at the [Department of Journalism](http://www.jour.hkbu.edu.hk/eng/people/dr-xinzhi-zhang/) of [Hong Kong Baptist University](http://www.hkbu.edu.hk). It is my honor to serve as the Associate Programme Director of the Interdisciplinary Concentration on [Data and Media Communication](http://bu-dmc.hkbu.edu.hk). Before joining the Baptist U in 2016, I was a Lecturer and the Co-Convener of the Academic Discipline of Humanities at the [School of Professional Education and Executive Development at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.speed-polyu.edu.hk) (2014-16). I obtained both Ph.D. in Media and Communication (2013) and M.A. *with Distinction* in Communication and New Media (2009) from the [Department of Media and Communication](http://www6.cityu.edu.hk/com/) at [City University of Hong Kong](www.cityu.edu.hk). 

Besides scholarly activities, I am a keen lover of music, films, and stage drama. I play piano and jazz drum.
